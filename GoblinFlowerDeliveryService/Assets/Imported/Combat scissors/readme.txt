Combat scissors comes with two versions - regular and light. They both have the same material and animation, but light model have lower vertex count, so you can use one of them depending on your project.
Model have a real world scale (yes, it's very big). 
Package comes with 4K PBR textures (Albedo, Normal, Metallic).
